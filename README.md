# Python: Deep Learning ML/AI - Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

## Overview

This Python script uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It loads stock price data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains an LSTM model, and visualizes the predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM model creation and training
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices
- Performance evaluation using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your stock data in a CSV file named `stock_data.csv` with at least two columns: 'Date' and 'Close' (closing price).

2. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python spp-ltsm.py
   ```

4. The script will output the training and testing RMSE values and display a plot of the actual stock prices vs. the predicted prices.

## Script Structure

- `load_and_preprocess_data()`: Loads and preprocesses the stock data from the CSV file.
- `create_dataset()`: Creates input-output pairs for training the LSTM model.
- `build_model()`: Defines and compiles the LSTM model architecture.
- `plot_results()`: Visualizes the actual vs. predicted stock prices.
- `main()`: Orchestrates the entire process from data loading to prediction and visualization.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following parameters:

- `time_step`: The number of time steps to look back (default is 100).
- Model architecture: You can modify the LSTM layers and their units in the `build_model()` function.
- Training parameters: Adjust batch size, epochs, and validation split in the `model.fit()` call within the `main()` function.

## Notes

- This script is for educational purposes and should not be used for actual financial decisions without further validation and risk assessment.
- The performance of the model can vary significantly depending on the quality and quantity of the input data.
- Consider using additional features and more advanced techniques for more robust predictions in a real-world scenario.

## Future Improvements

- Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
- Add support for multiple stock symbols.
- Incorporate additional technical indicators as features.
- Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., GRU, Transformer).
- Implement hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.
